and probably don't regret it that much, but I guess I have to do something
today to make up for that, or just be normal. And actually most of the day 
was gone in that lesson and sleeping after Asr until Magrib. However, It's
not the end of the world for me now. It's just that I don't know exactly what
I'm feeling now but what I know is that yesterday I didn't feel like doing a
thing. I don't know why I felt that way. but I felt it none the less.}
